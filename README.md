# Challenge One

The purpose of this challenge was to help improve the over accessibility of the website for its users and improve search engine optimization. 

In order to solve this problem, a minimum list of acceptance criteria was given which involved the following:

* Include semantic elements
* Elements follow a logical structure
* Contain alt attributes for every image and icon
* Heading attributes fall in sequential order
* Title is concise and descriptive


## Description

I've made the following changes in addition to the acceptance criteria mentioned above:

* Fixed broken links
* Added comments to html and css files
* Re-organized code in css to match the structure in html
* Combined css selectors that had the same css styling properties
* Removed some class attributes and class selectors

I've learned that it's important to use semantic elements whenever possible. This is more informative than using generic tags and it helps improve accessibility for its users. Alt attributes are also important for accesibility because it helps describe an image for people who may have visual impairment.
